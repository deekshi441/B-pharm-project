## Aim
To evaluate and quantify eugenol in the aerial and tubular parts of locally available cloves using the HPTLC method.

## Methods
Collected dried clove buds and separated them into 5 parts:
-Flower, Style, Mid-body (Ovules), Hypanthium, Tail
Performed extraction using:
-Soxhlet extraction
-Maceration
-Hydrodistillation
-Filtered and concentrated extracts.
-Analyzed samples using HPTLC with:
-Silica gel 60 F254 plates
-Mobile phase: Toluene : Petroleum Ether : Acetonitrile : Ethyl Acetate (0.3 : 1 : 5 : 5)
-Scanning at 254–450 nm using CAMAG TLC Scanner.

## Results
-Rf values were consistent (0.386–0.394) for all samples, confirming eugenol.
Eugenol concentration (Peak Area %):
-Flower: 58.22%
-Style: 79.81%
-Mid-Body (Ovules): 98.35% ⭐ highest
-Hypanthium: 90.37%
-Tail: 65.7%
-Conclusion: The mid-body (ovules) contain the maximum eugenol, while the flower and tail contain the least.

## Tools/Techniques Used
-Soxhlet extractor
-Hydrodistillation setup
-Mortar & pestle
-Rotary evaporator
-HPTLC (CAMAG Linomat V + TLC Scanner 4)
-UV cabinet

## Learnings
-Practical understanding of Soxhlet, maceration, and distillation methods.
-Hands-on experience in HPTLC sample application, development, and scanning.
-Ability to compare plant parts using chromatographic peaks & Rf values.
-Knowledge of eugenol distribution in different clove structures.
